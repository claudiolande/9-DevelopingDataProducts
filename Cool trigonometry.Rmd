## Cool trigonometry
This is the assignment of week 3 of Coursera Developing Data Products course. 

Never thought trigonometry could be cool, huh?

Look what a sine function can do!

```{r cool_trigo, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(2019-10-25)

x <- rep(seq(0, 10, 0.1),10)
y <- sapply(seq(0, 10, 0.1), function(x) rep(x,10))
y <- as.vector(y)
z <- sin(x-y)
```

## Fancy 3D scatter to impress reviewer
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
plot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, type = "scatter3d", color = ~z, 
        opacity = 0.5, mode = "lines+markers+text", name = "Cool trigonometry")
```

## Thanks!
